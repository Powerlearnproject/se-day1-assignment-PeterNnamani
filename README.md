Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.


software engineering involves the creation of easy to use softwares and programs that are user friendly. 
It is important because it helps in making this modern age a stress free one when carrying out several tasks and activities like shopping, learning and the rest. 
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
In 1968, the first NATO Software engineering conference held
In april 1975, billgates founded microsoft alongside one of his partners. 
in the same month the next year, steve jobs founded Apple. 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

the first is requirement: where the things needed for the cration and development of a software are gotten. 
second is the design of the software 
The third is the implementation of these requirements 
fourth is the testing of the software for bugs and compatibility 
fifth is the deployment followed by the maintenance 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

the waterfall methodology has a fixed timeline where the start and finish time has been projected. 
unlike the waterfall method, the agile method deals with expirimenting with different directions where schedules adapt as project advances. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

A software developer is responsible for the creation and development of a software. 
A quality assurance engineer deals more with the review and checkmating of the built software
the project manger plays every role involved with the launch of the software from pricing to the rest. 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDE's are important because they help in increasing developers productivity and make jobs easier e.g VScode
VCS help to manage file versions automatically than manually e.g GIT

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

changing requirements 
security: to tackle this its more of reviewing codes. 
customer demands 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

unit test: breaking down codes into units checking is the block of codes run normally the way they are meant to 
integration test : units, modules and components are tested 
system test : involves the testing of the general area of the software e.g interactiveness 
Acceptance test : testing the degree by which the software meets users needs 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

it involves the process of structuring an instruction that can be interpreted and understood by AI

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
